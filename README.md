# [DDiT](DDiT)
## Debris DIsks Tool

![screenshot](screenshots/DDiT.png)

A Python code to (quickly) produce synthetic images of debris disks, either in total and polarized intensity using the Henyey-Greenstein approximation or in thermal emission (making some approximations). In the model, the disk is not infinitely flat and it should work for any inclinations except for `i=0` or `i=90` (otherwise there may be some division by zero).

### Recent changes

- 2021/06/04: the vertical density profile is now an exponential fall-off, which gives more liberty when trying to constrain the scale height of debris disks. There is an additional free parameter `gamma` to control the fall-off (see Augereau et al. 1999).



### Installation and first model

To use the module, download the python files above and install it with the following (using the `develop` option so that any further changes are automatically included):
```python
python3 setup.py develop
```

Given that the code only uses matplotlib and numpy, it should work with python2 and python3. To compute a model, you can have a look at the end of the "DDiT.py" file, but in a nutshell, it is as simple as

```python
from DDiT import Disk
disk = Disk()
disk.compute_model(a = 0.6, incl = 60., e = 0.3)
disk.plot()
```

Alternatively, if you do not want to pass the arguments to the function (let's say you want to do some MCMC and want some liberty in choosing the free parameters), you can also do the following:

```python
from DDiT import Disk
disk = Disk()
disk.a = 0.6                 # in units of arcseconds
disk.incl = 60.              # in units of degrees
disk.e = 0.3
disk.compute_model()
```

One should note that all the angles should be provided in units of *degrees* (in previous versions of the code, this was not the case when updating values). Once the model is computed, you will have access to the following variables:

```python
disk.intensity               # the total intensity image
disk.polarized               # the polarized intensity image
disk.scattering              # the scattering angle in the midplane
disk.distance                # the distance to the star, in the midplane
disk.azimuth                 # the azimuthal angle, in the midplane
```

### Description of the code

The way the code works is that it first finds a bounding box where most of the dust density distribution is contained. This bounding box, which is a 3D ellipse, is computed from the reference radius, the outer slope of the density distribution, and the eccentricity. Then, for each row of pixels perpendicular to the _projected_ major axis of the disk (`x` axis), the `y` and `z` coordinates for the entry and exit points of the bounding box are estimated. The distance between the entry and exit points is divided in `nframe` images, and the 3D coordinates at the center of each cell are computed. The radial and vertical volumetric density are evaluated at the center of the grid. For scattered light or polarized intensity, the scattering angle is estimated from the 3D coordinates and the phase function is assumed to follow the Henyey-Greenstein approximation (with one coefficient for total intensity, and one coefficient for the polarized intensity). For thermal emission images, the temperature of the dust grain is computed using Eq. 3 of Wyatt 2008, `Tdust = 278.3/np.sqrt(r)` where `r` is the distance of the center of the grid to the star. Then the dust density is multiplied by a Planck function at the proper temperature. The final image is the sum of all those `nframe` images. The process is highlighted in the animation below.

### Input parameters

The `Disk` class has three possible parameters which are the following:

```python
nx = 300             # Size of the image in pixels
pixscale = 0.01226   # Size of one pixel in arcseconds
nframe = 50          # Number of frames (see above)
```

Both values of `nframe` and `nx` should be integers, and `nx` should be an even number. Once the class is called for the first time, those parameters should not be changed, otherwise you may get some very strange results. To compute thermal emission images, two other parameters should be provided:

```python
thermal = True       # A boolean
dpc = 35.34          # Distance of the central star in pc
```

The distance is only necessary to normalize the temperature distribution as explained above (as the semi-major axis is provided in units of arcseconds, the distance is required). 

For both thermal and scattered light images, there is the possibility to use a gaussian profile for the radial dust density distribution (otherwise, two power laws will be used). When you initialize the class you can pass it the following argument:

```python
gaussian = True
```

Afterwards, the method `compute_model` has the following input parameters:

```python
a = 0.85             # Semi-major axis of the disk in arcseconds
incl = 60.           # Inclination, in degrees
pa = 112.            # Position angle, in degrees
pin = 5.0            # Inner slope of the density distribution (>0)
pout = -15.0         # Outer slope of the density distribution (<0)
dr = 0.1             # Standard deviation of the gaussian profile (if gaussian is set to True)
e = 0.1              # Eccentricity
omega = 85.          # Argument of periapsis, in degrees
gsca = 0.5           # Henyey-Greenstein coefficient for total intensity
gpol = 0.5           # Henyey-Greenstein coefficient for polarized intensity
opang = 0.03         # Opening angle of the disk, in radians
s11 = None           # Scattered light phase function
s12 = None           # Polarized light phase function
```

Most of the parameters are self-explanatory, except the last two, which allow the user to provide arrays for the shape of the phase function, either in total or polarized intensity. The arrays should have two dimensions, so that there can be a phase function for the north and south sides of the disk. For instance, if one wants to define an isotropic polarized phase function for both sides, then `s12` can be defined as `np.ones(shape=(nb,2))` where `nb` is the number of scattering angles between `0` and `180` degrees. If either `s11` or `s12` is provided, the code automatically define an array `disk.theta` containing the scattering angles (in radians). One should note that if the user only provides `s11` (or `s12`) the code will automatically assign an isotropic phase function for `s12` (or `s11`).

The second dimension of the array is not necessarily always the north or south side, as it will depend on the position angle of the disk, so if you wish to use this feature you will have to make some tests to identify which side is which.

For thermal emission, the user should provide an additional parameter:
```python
wave = 850.          # Wavelength in microns
```
In that case, the parameters `gsca`, `gpol`, `s11`, and `s12` are no longer relevant (but the code will not complain).

The animation above showcases that the whole range of inclinations can be probed, and each image takes less than a few seconds to be computed. As a matter of fact, you will see that the computing time strongly depends on the inclination, because for face-on disks, there are more pixels where the dust density is not null, while for edge-on disks, the vast majority of the pixels do not intercept the bounding box of the disk. Finally, as a small note, in this animation, the scattered light phase function is slightly forward scattering (`gsca = 0.4`), but the disk does not become much brighter as the inclination increases because the cuts are re-evaluated for each frame.
